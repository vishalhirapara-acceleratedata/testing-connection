"""Imperative shell for publishing the dbt Docs static site to GitHub Releases.

Gathers release-existence via `gh release view`, calls the pure functional core
`build_release_publish_commands` (dbt_docs_publish.py) exactly once, then dispatches every
returned `gh` command. Invoked identically by both domain-ci-fabric-bundle's and
domain-ci-duckdb-bundle's publish-prod-manifest workflows -- CLAUDE.md's functional-
architecture rule: gather I/O upfront, call the core once, dispatch effects; never re-evaluate
the domain decision afterward.
